# Eclipse launchers for COMP23412 Hello MVC

## Synopsis

These launch files are set up to run various configurations of `Hello MVC` from within Eclipse.

* `Hello MVC package.launch` runs all tests and then creates a runnable `jar` file, with all required dependencies, so that `Hello MVC` can be run from the command-line.
* `Hello MVC run.launch` runs `Hello MVC` within Eclipse.
* `Hello MVC test.launch` runs all the tests included for `Hello MVC`.

## Usage

1. Right-click on a `.launch` file and select `Run As -> <launch name>` to use it.
1. The launch configuration should now also be available from the `Run` menu and tool-bar button.
